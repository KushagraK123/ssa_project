# Software System Architecture Project

## Description

This project is a practical implementation of Software System Architecture concepts, developed as part of academic coursework. It focuses on designing a robust and scalable software system by applying architectural principles such as modularization, separation of concerns, and design patterns. The objective is to simulate a real-world software development environment where architectural decisions directly impact code maintainability and system performance.

The system involves various components interacting together to form a cohesive architecture, potentially including modules such as:

- User management
- Service or business logic layers
- Data persistence layers
- Presentation interfaces (CLI or GUI)

> This repository demonstrates how theoretical software architecture principles can be applied in practice, using Java as the primary programming language.

## Features

- Modular Java architecture following SOLID principles
- Emphasis on component-based design
- Clear separation between layers (presentation, logic, data)
- Well-documented code and structure
- Ready for extension and testing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
